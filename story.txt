Once upon a time, there was an owl named Hoot. Hoot was adventurous and tame.

Hoot's favorite activity was going in the woods, so he went on a run through the woods. The woods were calm and mysterious, almost too calm...

...almost, but they were actually very safe, and very tame. Hoot liked feeling safe - that's why he ran instead of flying: it's much safer. He also always wore his favorite helmet. It was blue and red and had a little propeller on top for extra pizzaz

One day Hoot decided to go on an adventure. He met a friend pigeon who liked to fly in circles. He was very mysterous and Hoot was always jealous of his shiny wings. The world was to weird and so he went back home.

For home was a comfort to Hoot. Hoot loved to explore and run and be with other animals, but he also loved his home. One could call him a "home-body". Oh Hoot, so relateable. Aren't we all a little like Hoot?
