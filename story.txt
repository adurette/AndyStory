Once upon a time, there was an owl named Hoot. Hoot was adventurous and tame.

Hoot's favorite activity was going in the woods, so he went on a run through the woods. The woods were calm and mysterious, almost too calm...

...almost, but they were actually very safe, and very tame. Hoot liked feeling safe - that's why he ran instead of flying: it's much safer. He also always wore his favorite helmet. It was blue and red and had a little propeller on top for extra pizzaz
